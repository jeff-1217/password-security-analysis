### 🧠 Objective
- Evaluate password strength using **online tools** (e.g., passwordmeter.com)
- Create and test **passwords with varying complexity**
- Understand **common password attacks** (Brute Force, Dictionary)
- Develop your own **password strength checker** for practical understanding

---

### 💻 My Own Password Strength Checker Website
I developed a **custom password strength checker** using **HTML**.  
It analyzes password complexity in real-time based on:
- Length
- Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
- Common password patterns

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://password-strength-checker-alpha.vercel.app](https://password-strength-checker-alpha.vercel.app)
